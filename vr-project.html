             <p>I made connections with the 3D modeling society and game society to collaborate in building a VR game. From the three societies, I created a management team of 4 to head the project, with myself as project manager, and three separate teams of between four and six people.
                Apart from a single member of the management team who was experienced in VR, the entire team working on the project had never developed a VR game, with most never having developed any game at all.</p>

             <p>To avoid issues of physical touch, we went for a shooting 'capture the flag' game. In order to make the most out of the VR, we went for a game set on the rooftops of the city. This also allowed for easy reuse of game assets in the environment. The AI aspect would be implemented through a pathfinding AI opponent and some AI that would find and shoot at you.</p>

           <p>We experienced several setbacks throughout the project, including people having to drop out due to other engagements. Despite this, a core group of 5 of us maintained development throughout and we managed to finish the project within a year. While there are a lot of parts of the game that are far from perfect, this was an achievement for a team without any experience in creating a VR game (and most with very little development experience). </p>
<p>The final product was a cross platform (VR and web) game.</p>
