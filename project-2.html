   <h2>Motivation</h2>
  
    
     <p>After Britain’s transition away from pandemic restrictions, news about sexual harassment and alcohol spiking in clubs became alarmingly frequent. After conducting desk research and interviewing our peers, we noticed that these were common concerns of club-goers. We set ourselves the goal of redesigning an improved clubbing experience by making it safer and more enjoyable.


   Although the existing punishments for spiking and harassment are severe, the interviewees brought to our attention that these crimes are often not reported by victims. We understood that solving the issue of night-time safety requires not only action from the government, but also an intervention on behalf of the clubs themselves. Furthermore, too many clubs are not being held accountable for failing to ensure their customers’ safety. Our solution attempts to address this issue.</p>

   <h4>Testing Assumptions</h4>
  
    
 <p>In order to ensure our work was without bias, we tested our assumptions at the start of the design process. We created a word map (ex. 6) with what we associated with nights out. While it couldn't fully encompass the full biases we held, it allowed us to notice any connotations we already held. </p>

<div class="row">
 <h4>Empathise</h4>
 <p>After becoming conscious of biases, the next step became to research the truth without bias.</p>
 <div class="col-sm-6">


     <h5>Observation and User Diaries </h5>


     <p>Since the social norms of the club environment are distinct, we felt it was important to observe in a non-participative and participatory way in order to gain different perspectives. We conducted a contextual enquiry for the former and a user diary for the latter. The insights from both have been condensed below. </p>
     </div>
    
     <div class="col-sm-6">
     <h5>Interviews</h5>
     <p>9 students of male and female gender, and 1 medic, were interviewed. The questionnaire was designed to elicit open answers and, where it interested them, researchers encouraged participants to elaborate on points. From this emerged unexpected insights; the interviews were the fundamental driver in pivoting our problem statement.</p>
  
   </div>
 </div>
 <br>


 <div class="row">
   <h5>A pivot</h5>
         <p>While we initially got vocal concern for drink spiking, through our interviews we found that this was less of a concern. In light of the recent rise in spikings across the UK, almost all interviewees drink at home or at a friend’s house before attending an event.
  
           More recent reports of needles being used to spike victims rather than drinks also expanded the scope of the problem. Further, when we examined the issue against our goals of accessibility and inclusivity, we found that ensuring that our solution was inclusive of all groups may be more difficult, since women having their drinks spiked by heterosexual men had very different roots and contexts, and thus, by possible extension, solutions, than drugging that occurred between homosexual men in clubs.
          
           We instead found a more implicit issue: if asked whether they would report sexual harassment if it occurred to them, none of the respondants would. A few of our peers said that they did not feel comfortable talking to the staff, and others explained that even if they tried to report the incident, it was nearly impossible to find the perpetrator in a dark crowded setting.</p>

   <h4>Ideate</h4>
  
     <p>Informed by  work done in the defined  stage, we set up the requirements for what we need from our solution. There are three main points that we defined:</p>
     <p>Our solution must take into account:</p>


     <ul>
       <li>situational disabilities such as darkness and drunkenness</li>
       <li>different social norms within the club</li>
       <li>barriers to reporting</li>
     </ul>
  
    
  
  
 </div> 
</div>


<div class="row">
 <div class="col-sm-6">




  
     <p>We iterated back to the start of the process in order to research what the barriers to reporting would be. We found this included feeling  ashamed, intimidated, and a lack of knowledge about how to report issues. All of this led to our final solution, which can be found in the presentation at the start of this section.</p>
