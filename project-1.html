       <p>To effectively manage engineers, I needed to understand what it was like to be one. While I already was proficient in front end development, I wanted to understand the full stack intimately, from the very beginning to the end. This project was purposely done by myself as a result.
          How might we redesign the food shopping and preparation experience?

   The first step was understanding the problem. The problem for me came up every single night - what should I eat tonight?
   I always reframe problems as one of experience: how might we redesign the experience of food making? This process is a longer one than my initial problem -- it encapsulates not only thinking about what to eat, but also planning to buy the ingredients, buying the ingredients and creating the meal. problem: Itâ€™s difficult to choose what to eat for dinner; food is one of the major causes of CO2.</div>

     My philosophy derives from behavioral science - make the best choice the easiest. In any system I'm designing, I always want to design friction away (or add it to discourage choices).
   There was a lot of friction in the system. The act of trying to find something to eat could be made frictionless - I spent a lot of time browsing through videos
   - I could instead be browsing through food options and placing easily saving them throughout the week. Then, if I still didn't have a week's worth of food, I could create a generator that would generate food based on my saved preferences. This would get around another piece of friction: having to design around food goals (such as no sugar, or 130 grams of protein). I also made a feature that would automatically fill up my micronutrients with additional foods to add throughout.
   There were also typical features, such as the ability to save recipes, and some specifically made for this, such as the ability to save a meal plan.

 <div class="col-sm-6"><p>I taught myself Django, html, CSS and javascript (including Jquery and Jquery through watching tutorials and adapting existing code.

     <p>After I created a UX I thought reduced as much friction as possible from the system, I first designed the UI on Figma. I intended for the UI to be intuitive, clean, but also have a clear identity, hence having a background color that was neither white nor dark and using green as a highlight color.</p>

   Next steps: while the app works and is deployed, the problem isn't fully solved yet. Currently, a lot of the main features of the app require signing in. This represents friction that many potential new users would not be necessarily willing to overcome if they haven't yet been convinced of its use, which they can't be without being logged in.
