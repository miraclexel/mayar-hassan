          <h2>Innovative</h2>
          <p>I like to innovate and to be the first to try out new innovations. I did influencer marketing at its infancy within my first business, joined the AI soc as a head of marketing at a time when Open AI were still small enough to do free speaking engagements, and led a VR team when Meta was just starting to get into VR.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>UCL Management Science</h3>
        <p>I'm in my final year of an Msci in Management Science with a minor in Connected Systems (IOT) from UCL, which has given me theoretical knowledge of a variety of topics including data analytics, finance, machine learning, behavioural science and operations management 
          as well as it’s practical implementation in leading teams, including in sprints. </p>
          <h3>Prior education</h3>
          <p> I have A-levels in Philosophy and Ethics, Geography and Mathematics (A*, A, A) </p>
          <p> I have 13 GCSEs, at the equivalent of 6 As and 7 A*s</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Having been born in Egypt, growing up in Sweden, and finally spending my teen years in the UK, I have a diverse perspective that has informed my multidiciplinary take on solving problems.</p>
        <p>It's lead to me engaging in a wide range in initiatives from running an arts production and environmental transformations in my early teens, to starting an educational publishing company in my late teens, to passing the tests to become a military intelligence officer (which then got disrupted by the pandemic), leading a VR game development team, and self teaching software development.  </p>
        <p>A common theme that unites all of my experiences is my love of problem solving, innovation and leadership.</p>

        <h2>Why I'm different</h2>

        <h3>I'm cross diciplinary</h3>
        <p>I have both theoretical and practical knowledge in a variety of subjects including finance; strategy; marketing; behavioural science and organisational psychology; statistical analyis; software developement; and hardware development. </p>
      
        <h3>I have full stack experience</h3>
        <p>Not only have I got experience managing the entire product cycle, I also have experience working within the entire product cycle, from understanding the problem and engaging with key stakeholders, to designing the solution, to prototype, feedback, building it and releasing updates to it.
        </p>
        <h3>I am human centered</h3>
        <p>
          Ultimately, every solution relies on humans and so the success of any solution relies on understanding humans. Every aspect of every project I work on therefore hinges on understanding behavioural science.
       </p>
       <h3>I am a self starter</h3>
       <p> 
        One of my core strengths is initiative. I'm good at starting projects and engaging with the neccesary stakeholders in order to get the ball rolling.
