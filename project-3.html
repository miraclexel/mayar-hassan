  <p>This program took place full time over two weeks remotely, unsupervised, as a marked project by the department of engineering. However, many of the team had clashing responsibilities, meaning that very few could make it for the entire time neccesary. This meant that I had to design tasks in a way that they could be done asynchronously.
  A figma board was used for this purpose.
  The first step was to research as much as possible about the problem.
  While secondary research is important in laying the groundwork for understanding the problem, primary research - especially observation, user diaries and suplementary in-depth interviews - are crucial to human-centred design. 
    However, since we did not have access to any of these methods, we substituted primary research with watching videos about farming in India as a kind of psudo-observation.
  
  Everything that every person on the team found was put on a mind map to allow for visual links to be made between ideas</p>

    <p>while design thinking likes to keep from jumping at solutions too early in the process, I know that inspiration can jump at any point. 
    As such a mind map was available throughout the process to place any ideas down. At the end of our define stage, we also spend a couple of minutes together brainstorming about any obvious solutions that we'd already been thinking about.

        <p>A more formalised process of ideation followed. brainwriting is one of my preferred forms of ideation as it forces a large quantity of ideas to be generated that all focus on answering specific problem statements.</p>
      <p>In order to brainwrite, I first wrote the name of each member of our team down in both column and row names to create a Matrix.
      I asked each team member to choose a problem statement (that must be unique to others chosen) and write it under their name.
      I then gave everyone a day to go through and write a possible solution to everyone's problem statement. The solution must be unique from everyone else's solution to that problem.
      This task is designed to be done under timed conditions in real time, with team members rotating through others' ideas with 2 minutes to get down a solution to each problem statement. 
      However, having recently redone this excersise in real time on a seperate project, I found that it was more successful when team members could find solutions in their own time. 
      One downside, however, as can be seen in the image is that sometimes team members will do their part after everyone else has already finished and the team moved on. This was, however, unique since that particular team member had been flying.</p>
