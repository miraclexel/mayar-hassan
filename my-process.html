          <h2>Reframe the problem as one of human experience</h2>
          <p>Excluding purely scientific or mathemetical problems, 
            the vast majority of problems in the world can be reframed as ones of human experience. 
            By doing so, we ensure that we root our solution in reality rather than the theoretical idea.</p>
            <p>For example "How can X corp increase sales of Y product line?" can be reframed as "how can we improve the experience of finding, shopping for and consuming Y product line?"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explaination" data-t="1">
          <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i>
          <h2>Analyse the entire system</h2>
          <p>As with everything in life, most problems are systemic - they don't occur in a vaccuum. As such, it's important to analyse the entire system in order to solve the problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explaination" data-t="2">
          <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i>
          <h2>Find the bright spots</h2>
          <p>It can be tempting to try to reinvent the wheel when faced with a new problem. But with invention neccesarily comes processes of failure (even with the best planning). 
            Instead, we can look for 'bright spots': existing parts of the system that are working better than the average. 
            By working to scale bright spots, we've got a foundation that we know works and that we can then iterate upon. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="explaination" data-t="3">
          <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i>
          <h2>Make the best option the easiest</h2>
          <p>Choice architecture and the reduction of friction are incredibly important when trying to design a solution that will actually work in practice. Humans tend to choose the easiest option. So making the best option the easiest makes it the most likely to be chosen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="explaination" data-t="4">
          <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></i>
          <h2>Prototype, gather feedback, iterate, repeat</h2>
          <p>There's no point in spending a long time on a solution that we have no idea will work. It's better to create something quickly, get feedback from stakeholder, make changes and repeat the process.</p>

    <h2>
      Communicate the process and purpose of each step effectively to the team </h2>
      <p>
        I’ve used the process directly with engineers multiple times. When a lot of engineers see a problem, they immediately want to jump to solutions. In order to effectively ensure

    <h2>Reframe the problem as one of experience</h2>
    <p>
      Most problems in the world can be reframed as one of human experience. Not only does this centre the human and the process into our thinking from the very start, it forces us to narrow down to specific problems. 
      when it comes to changing behaviour, which is the root of most problems in the world, the most effective thing to do is to is to

  <div class="left">
    <h2>Analyse assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      It’s important for the entire team to make their assumptions - about the people, processes and situations - known. This serves two purposes - 1 -- it ensures that we challenge those assumptions and build a solution for reality rather than for the biases in our minds; 2 -- One of the key issues that needs to be overcome in teams is the inability to read each others’ minds. This is one point of many where we ensure we’re working from the same starting point.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <h2>
      Secondary research
      </h2>
      <p>
        This stage involves researching everything we can about the problem, including trying to find out whether our assumptions were true.
        </p>

  </div>

  <div class="left">
    <h2>
      Primary research 
      </h2>
      <p>
        Primary research, including using ethnographic research (observation) and interviews is incredibly important in understanding the problem. Actually experiencing the problem is one of the most useful ways of ensuring that the solution works within the context of the problem.
        
        </p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <h2>
      Ideate 
      </h2>
      <p>
       In this stage we ask: What has worked? In what circumnstances is the problem not seen? What do users currently score the experience and what would the experience look like if that score increased by 1?  The point is to create as many possible solutions to the problem from as many angles as possible. We can then go through the solutions and evaluate them.
        </p>
    
  </div>

  <div class="left">
    <h2>Rapid prototyping</h2>
    <p> In this stage we build the quickest prototype possible, test it with end users and key stakeholders, observe and listen, either go back to prototyping, or - if neccesary - to ideating. Repeat until a solution that is beautiful, desirable, feasible and viable is achieved.</p>
